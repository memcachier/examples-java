# MemCachier Java Example

This is an example Java Jetty app that uses
[MemCachier](http://www.memcachier.com) to cache Fibonacci digits.

You can view a working version of this app
[here](http://memcachier-examples-java.herokuapp.com). Running this
app on your local machine in development will work as well, although
you'll need to install a local memcached server. MemCachier is
currently only available with various cloud providers.

## Client

This example uses
[Spymemcached](https://code.google.com/p/spymemcached/) as the client
for connecting to memcachier.

Another very good choice is
[XMemcached](https://github.com/killme2008/xmemcached).
